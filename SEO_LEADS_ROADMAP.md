## 3. Content That Targets High-Intent Keywords

**Why:** More relevant pages = more chances to rank and capture leads for “WhatsApp API”, “bulk messaging”, “chatbot”, etc.

| Content type | Example topics (align with what people search) |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Blog posts** | “How to send bulk WhatsApp messages officially 2026”, “WhatsApp Business API pricing India”, “Best WhatsApp chatbot for e-commerce”, “WhatsApp API vs Business App”. |
| **Comparison / alternatives** | “Ask Meister vs WATI”, “WhatsApp marketing tools comparison”. |
| **Use-case guides** | “WhatsApp marketing for schools”, “Bulk WhatsApp for real estate”, “WhatsApp automation for clinics”. |

## 4. Turn Visitors Into Leads (Conversion)

**Why:** More attention only helps if you capture leads.

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| **Connect contact form** | Replace `console.log` with real backend: Formspree, Netlify Forms, or your API → save to CRM/email (e.g. HubSpot, Zoho, Google Sheet). |
| **Lead magnet** | Offer a PDF: “WhatsApp Marketing Checklist” or “Bulk Messaging Best Practices” in exchange for email; gate it on a simple landing page and send to Contact/Demo. |
| **Clear CTAs** | Keep “Start Free Trial” and “Book a Demo” pointing to /contact or /pricing. Add one CTA above the fold on key pages. |
| **Track conversions** | In GA4, create events: “form_submit”, “click_start_trial”, “click_contact”. Set these as conversions so you can see which pages and sources bring leads. |
| **Optional: UTM / source** | Use links like `/contact?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=cta` or `?source=pricing` so you know which page drove the lead. |

## 5. Backlinks & Authority

**Why:** Strong, relevant backlinks help rankings and referral traffic.

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| **Directories** | List on: G2, Capterra, SoftwareSuggest, IndiaMART (if relevant). Use same NAP (name, address, phone) as on site and Google Business. |
| **Guest posts** | Write for marketing/SaaS blogs: “WhatsApp for business”, “Bulk messaging compliance”. Link back to a key page (e.g. /whatsapp-api or /features/bulk-messaging). |
| **Partners** | Ask integration partners (WooCommerce, Zapier, etc.) for a listing or case study with a link. |
| **HARO / Qwoted** | Answer journalist queries about WhatsApp/marketing; get links from news sites. |

## 6. Paid Search (Optional – Fast Leads)

| **High-intent keywords** | Run campaigns for: “WhatsApp Business API”, “WhatsApp bulk messaging”, “WhatsApp marketing tool”, “WhatsApp API pricing”. |
| **Landing pages** | Send ads to /pricing or a dedicated “WhatsApp API” landing page, not just homepage. |
| **Track conversions** | Link Google Ads to GA4; measure form submits or “Contact” clicks as conversions. |
| **Remarketing** | Retarget visitors who didn’t submit the form (e.g. blog readers, pricing page). |
